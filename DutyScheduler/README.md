# Getting started guide

### 1. Crete new postgres database. 
Use pgadmin or any other Postgre SQL database admimnistration tool. You can choose any database name, owner and server port you like, just don't forget to check that yur configuration settings from step 2 are correct.

### 2. Set connection string
In `appsettings.json` file, change the `ConnectionStrings` block so that it maches your connection string.

```
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Postgres": "Host=localhost;Port=5433;Username=postgres;Password=postgres;Database=DutyScheduler"
  }
```
#### :warning: Do not change the `"Postgres"` key in the specified block, because it is referenced elsewhere in code.

### 3. Run migrations
Open up powershell or cmd and `cd` into `DutyScheduler\DutyScheduler.Service\src\DutyScheduler` directory. From there, run the following commands

```
dotnet ef migrations add <migration_name>
dotnet ef database update
```

#### :exclamation: You'll have to repeat step 3 each time your models change, in order to have those model changes propagated in the database.


### 4. Documentation
When you run the application, docs will be avaliable at [http://localhost:5000/swagger/ui/index.html](http://localhost:5000/swagger/ui/index.html).

Document your API methods with xml comments and the xml docs will be generated and displayed at the specified URL.
